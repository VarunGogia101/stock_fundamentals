A publicly-traded company’s market value often reflects its financial performance, as captured in fundamental data. This data is comprised of reported financial information such as income, revenue, assets, dividends, and debt. It is presumed that a company’s stock price should ultimately move towards the company’s intrinsic value. One investing strategy called value investing is based on the idea that long-run prices reflect this intrinsic value and that the best features for predicting long-term intrinsic value are a company’s fundamental data


In a typical quantitative investment strategy, we sort all available stocks according to some value factor and then buy those stocks which score highest. Many quantitative value factors are obtained by taking fundamental data in a ratio to a stock’s price (e.g. Operating Income/ Enterprise Value). Those with high-value factor ratios are called value stocks. The idea is that value factors should identify companies that are inexpensively priced with respect to current company fundamentals.


In this challenge, we try a new approach - can we identify value stocks depending on the how well-priced the stock currently is with respect to its future fundamentals.


In other words,task is to predict future fundamental data, specifically Operating Income and Revenue, based on 10 years of fundamental data.
